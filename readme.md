_Preserved as is._

An old project from school days. Pulled from archives with all the files being as is.
The only addition is this readme.

Probably inspired by minecraft's terrain generation.

## Run

Executables should work on all windows platforms.

Tested on `win10` and `ubuntu 20.04` with `wine`.

## Build

Needs investigation. 


As far as I remember, the project was built in `Delphi7`.
